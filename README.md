Croatia's Open Data
============

[![Slack Status](http://slackin.codeforcroatia.org/badge.svg)](http://codeforcroatia.org/slackin)

## Open data priorities

See [dashboard](https://github.com/codeforcroatia/open-data/projects) for datasets that need some love.

## Datasets we got so far

Anyone can contribute datasets in this repo's 'master' branch. Once dataset is uploaded, you can also add it to our [JKAN - Open Data Portal](https://data.codeforcroatia.org/) first independent lightweight Croatian open data portal.

Collection of datasets in this branch uses _Frictionless Data Specification_. 

**Frictionless Data** is about removing the friction in working with data through the development of a set of tools, specifications, and best practices for publishing data. The heart of Frictionless Data is *Data Package*, a containerization format for any kind of data based on existing practices for publishing open-source software.

For more info about the project as a whole, please visit [frictionlessdata.io](http://frictionlessdata.io).

Create and verify your datapackage.json at [create.frictionlessdata.io](https://create.frictionlessdata.io/).
